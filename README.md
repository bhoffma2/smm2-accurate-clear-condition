SMM2 accurate clear condition

These functions will calculate if a clear condition will be "at least" or an "all", to match what would be seen in-game.

All functions can be used, but if you are importing this into your code and just want the clear condition, only use the IsCCLeastAll function.
Look at the leveldata.h file for documentation on functions.
Use the driver.c file to run the program on an unencrypted level file.
