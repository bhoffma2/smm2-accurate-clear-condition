SMM2 Clear Condition Least/All calculator

These functions will calculate if a clear condition will be "at least" or an "all", to match what would be seen in-game.

All functions can be used, but if you are importing this into your code and just want the clear condition, only use the IsCCLeastAll function
Look at the leveldata.h file for documentation on functions
